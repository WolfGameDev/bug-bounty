# Alpha Game Bug Bounty

This repository contains the code that will be used for Alpha Game

## Bug Bounty

I am offering up to $50,000 as a bounty for any vulnerabilities found. The amount received by the party that notifies me of a vulnerability will be determined based on severity.

The whitepaper is available [here](https://wolf.game/alpha-game-whitepaper) for expected mechanics.

Vulnerabilities should be submitted via this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWr5PxOq5NhFEG8jgPAG8IcTRDyj_X1M-RIwPNg8z6iBM3Kg/viewform) and the first submitter of any vulnerability will be eligible.

## Code For Review

The scope of the Bug Bounty is for the contract: Allegiance.sol. Only this new, specifically named smart contract is in scope.

Happy Hunting,
The Shepherd & The Herdsman
