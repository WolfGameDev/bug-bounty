## Bug Bounty
​
I am offering up to $50,000 as a bounty for any vulnerabilities found. The amount received by the party that notifies me of a vulnerability will be determined based on severity.
​
CaveGamePouchClaim enables players to claim WOOL found in the caves in a WOOL Pouch. CaveGamePouchClaim.sol also implements a claim method that require a signature from an administrative private signing key.

GemRedemption records which FarmerGems have been applied to which Farmers. The state of that contract will define which Farmers are guaranteed specific types. It will have a deadline which will be enforced by pausing the contract.
​
Vulnerabilities should be submitted via this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWr5PxOq5NhFEG8jgPAG8IcTRDyj_X1M-RIwPNg8z6iBM3Kg/viewform) and the first submitter of any vulnerability will be eligible.
​
## Scope of the bounty
​
The scope of the Bug Bounty contains the smart contracts: CaveGamePouchClaim.sol and GemRedemption.sol. Only these new, specifically named smart contracts are in scope.
